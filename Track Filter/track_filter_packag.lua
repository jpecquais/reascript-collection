  # Track Filter
  ## Description
  The Track Filter script is a simple GUI based tool to show/hide tracks in MCP and TCP based on their name.
  It requires my script **Visible tracks fit TCP height** to work !
  **Note that you also need to install the common extension which also provides necessary functions.**
  ## TODO
  - [ ] Add options to affect TCP visiblity only
  - [ ] Add options to affect MCP visiblity only
  - [ ] Add options to show parent tracks of match tracks (currently on)
  - [ ] Add options to show children tracks of match tracks (currently on)
